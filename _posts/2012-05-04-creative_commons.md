excerpt: Did you choose a NC (non commercial) variant of Creative Commons? It might be good to consider this.

In these days the blogger's conference [re:publica] (http://www.re-publica.de/12/) is taking place in Berlin. This is a good opportunity to think about the license under which you offer your content.

Many blogs are published under a variant of [Creative Commons] (http://www.creativecommons.org). And most of them refer to a "non commercal" (NC) clause. But it might be a better decision to choose a variant which allows commercial use but requires from the author, to publish his new work under the same license (["CC BY-SA"] (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/?lang=en)).

For that reason Wikimedia, irights.info and Creative Commons Deutschland published a [brochure] (http://www.wikimedia.de/images/a/a2/IRights_CC-NC_Leitfaden_web.pdf) (in German language) to clear up the NC clause.
