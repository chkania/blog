After I have eliminated Flash from my MacBook Air my current favorite [Fliqio](http://9031.com/goodies/#fliqlo) does not work anymore.

Today I [found](http://www.aptgetupdate.de/2012/05/08/minimalist-clock-screensaver-fr-den-mac/) ["Minimalist Clock Screensaver"](http://drbl.in/dVfR) which is available in 12h and 24h format.
